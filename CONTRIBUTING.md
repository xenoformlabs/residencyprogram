Artists are the Contributors
=============================

The resident artists at Xenoform Labs are the contributors. For each resident artist, we will establish a GitHub repo for your work here.

## Getting Git


We realize that some of you aren't familiar with GitHub and that the Git tutorials can make you cross-eyed-crazy, so here are some simple steps.


When you get to the residency, we will establish a GitHub repo for your work that will live on the Xenoform Labs GitHub page: [https://github.com/xenoformlabs
]()

Your residency account will include a simple ReadMe file (project description in the very least) and a LICENSE file.

All work you produced here will be licensed:
CC BY-NC-SA


### Pushing Changes
Open Terminal window (Mac) then cd into your directory [drag from desktop, etc]

```
 git add . [this will add all files into repo]
 git commit -m "commit message"
 git push -u origin master
```

### Pulling Changes

```
git pull origin master
```

## Brainstorming Sessions

For the brainstorming sessions, we definitely want to open source all of these. For now, we will photograph/scan the index cards and upload them.

This can be tedious! Is there a way to make this easier? I'm not sure.

## Event Photos

Selected event photos will all be open.


## Other Open
For the time being until we sort out the needs of the artists, the artwork itself — these could be for example high-resolution image files — is not necessarily open.

We'll have to work this out.

There are practical considerations and copyright considerations, so let's see how this unfolds.
